## Project description
The ePLANET project targets the deployment of a new clustering governance for energy transition based on a digital framework to share harmonized information.
ePLANET will provide public authorities with a set of tools to improve decision-making and policy-making, to facilitate the adoption of new or improved policies and actions plans, the implementation of Energy Transition Measures (ETM) and actions and to foster the sharing of Energy Transition information at vertical and horizontal level.
The overall objective of ePLANET project is to develop and implement a methodology to enhance and facilitate the energy transition multilevel governance of public authorities, and the coordinated adoption of ETM for achieving the European sustainability targets.
The ePLANET project had a duration of three years in which a proof of concept was developed in three pilot regions: in the province of Girona in Spain, the island of Crete in Greece and in the Zlín region of the Czech Republic.

### Project Objectives
- To establish a transparent and coherent information sharing platform able to allow systematic data integration, direct comparison of ETM, policies and data among public authorities.
- To deploy multi-level working groups of related public authorities and stakeholders for sharing of information and to enable a collaborative approach in development and updating of Energy Transition plans.
- To enable digitalization of the energy transition plans and energy transition meaures of the public authorities as base for coherence, sharing, coordination and integration.
- To support new adopters and consolidate existing networks.
- To institutionalize ePLANET networks and multi-level working groups.

## In this repository
The ePLANET backend modules of data gathering, harmonization, and data model extracted from common ontology are presented in this repository.
As each pilot site has its own format and different data sources, there is a gathering and harmonization process for each one of the pilot sites.
